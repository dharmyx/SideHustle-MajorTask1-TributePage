                    <p class="textz">You died <strong> MAY 11th 2002 (19 years ago),</strong> It was the most devastating event ever. I still remember seeing your face every now and then anytime i close my eyes. I wish God didn't need you in heaven so soon because i need you more now that i'm a father. My son long for his grandmother but you are no more. it saddens my heart, because i've always talked about how you will take care of my children when you was alive, but God knows best.</p><br>
                    <p class="textz">To the world you were one person, but to me you were the world. You didn’t have much, but we always felt like we had everything. You didn’t leave millions in your bank account, but you left a legacy worth much more. You taught me love, patience and endurance. You taught me how to pray and led by example. You praised me whenever I did good and pointed out my mistakes with that gentle voice.</p><br>
                    <p class="textz">If roses grow in heaven,
                        Lord please pick a bunch for me,
                        Place them in my Mother’s arms
                        and tell her they’re from me.Tell her I love her and miss her,
                        and when she turns to smile,
                        place a kiss upon her cheek
                        and hold her for awhile.Because remembering her is easy,
                        I do it every day,
                        but there’s an ache within my heart
                        that will never go away. Adieu Mum!</p><br>
